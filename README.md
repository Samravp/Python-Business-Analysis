# Python Challenges

## PyBank

In this project, I created a Python script for analysing the financial records of a company. 

I had a set of financial data, the dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

My Python script analyses the records to calculate each of the following:


- The total number of months included in the dataset;


- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;


- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;


- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period;


- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyPoll

Using a set of poll data, I wrote a Python script that analyses the votes. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

The final Python script calculates each of the following:


- The total number of votes cast


- A complete list of candidates who received votes


- The percentage of votes each candidate won


- The total number of votes each candidate won


- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
