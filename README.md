# Python Challenges

## PyBank

In this project, I created a Python script for analysing the financial records of a company. 

I had a set of financial data, the dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

My Python script analyses the records to calculate each of the following:


- The total number of months included in the dataset;


- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;


- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;


- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period;


- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
